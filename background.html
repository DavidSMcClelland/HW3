        <h2 class="tab">Education</h2>

            <p class="tabw">I completed a Masters of Business Administration and passed the Uniform CPA Examination while at Cleveland State University.   </p>
    
        <h2 class="tab"> Experience</h2>
               
            <p class="tabw">I have been privileged to be invited into peopleâ€™s confidences since I was a crisis intervention counselor at a suicide hotline at 18 and other people have regularly trusted me with their personal information, to handle sensitive tasks and to be trustworthy since then.</p>

            <p class="tabw">Until December, I operated a high quality, low cost veterinary practice offering affordable care to pets who might not have received veterinary care with a traditional practice.</p>    
    
       <h2 class="tab">Accomplishments</h2>
     
            <p class="tabw">After 4 days as a temporary bookkeeper the Animal Protective League offered me a full time position. I left that position to finish my masters degree and the APL hired me back as Executive Director.</p>
    
        <h2 class="tab">Skills</h2>
     
            <p class="tabw">I have worked with customers and volunteers for years. Virtually always, these relationships are warm and productive for all concerned. But sometimes there are problems which must be resolved.</p>

            <p class="tabw">I have managed people and money for over 10 years.</p>

            <p class="tabw">I can also do full bookkeeping and accounting through financial statements.</p>
    
    
        <h2 class="tab">Passion </h2>
     
            <p class="tabw">I love working with other people. I love problem solving and doing creative work. I am willing and able to devote the time and attention to detail to make things happen.</p>
